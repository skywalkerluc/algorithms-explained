# Algorithms Explained
A collection of (mostly) technical things every software developer should know.
A resource for new developers learning data structures and algorithms.

:point_up: *These are resources I can recommend to every programmer regardless of their skill level or tech stack*

The main idea here is:
- Given a specific challenge, feel free to contribute adding a way to resolve the challenge (using any language you want) and a .md file explaining your approach and maybe time and space complexity.

- Don't feel pressured to add any time and space complexity, just sharing how you came up with the idea
  is enough.

*P.P.S. [Contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome! Take a good look here before getting started*
